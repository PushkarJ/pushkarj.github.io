# About

Pushkar Joglekar is a _Sr. Security Engineer_ currently working at [VMware Tanzu](https://tanzu.vmware.com/tanzu/) with the goal to "Make _Kubernetes_ Secure For All". He is a [CNCF Security - TAG](#cncf-cloud-native-computing-foundation) Tech Lead and leads the [Kubernetes SIG Security Tooling](#kubernetes) Sub-Project.

During the last couple of years, he feels incredibly fortunate to have written the security chapters in Nigel Poulton’s [“The Kubernetes Book”](#publications) which he looks forward to updating every year. Prior to this current role, he worked on securing massive Kubernetes deployments at [Visa](https://usa.visa.com) (end user), playing a dual role of a security architect and engineer. He is also the co-creator of award winning container runtime security tool: [MASHUP](#awards)

In his free time, he loves taking photos, watching cricket and firmly believes that Chai fixes everything!

Pushkar is based in San Francisco Bay Area!

# About

Pushkar Joglekar is a _Sr. Security Engineer_ currently working at [VMware Tanzu](#vmware-tanzu) with the goal to "Make _Kubernetes_ Secure For All". He wears multiple hats in the community as a:
- [CNCF Security - TAG](#cncf-cloud-native-computing-foundation) Tech Lead
- [Associate Kubernetes Security Response Committee](https://github.com/kubernetes/committee-security-response#security-response-committee-src) Member 
- [Kubernetes SIG Security Tooling](#kubernetes) Sub-Project Lead

During the last few years, he feels incredibly fortunate to have written the security chapters in Nigel Poulton’s [“The Kubernetes Book”](#publications) which he looks forward to updating every year. Prior to this current role, he worked on securing massive Kubernetes deployments at [Visa](#visa-inc) (end user), playing a dual role of a security architect and engineer. He is also the co-creator of award winning container runtime security tool: [MASHUP](#awards)

In his free time, he loves taking photos, watching cricket and firmly believes that Chai fixes everything!

Pushkar is based in San Francisco Bay Area!

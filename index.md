# About

Pushkar Joglekar is a _Sr. Cloud Security Engineer II_ currently working at [Credit Karma](#credit-karma). He also wears multiple hats in cloud native community with the goal to "Make _Kubernetes_ Secure For All":
- [CNCF Security - TAG](#cncf-cloud-native-computing-foundation) Co-Chair 
- [Kubernetes SIG Security Tooling](#kubernetes) Sub-Project Lead

Since 2019, he feels incredibly fortunate to have written the security chapters in Nigel Poulton’s [“The Kubernetes Book”](#publications) which he looks forward to updating every year. Prior to this current role, he worked on securing massive Kubernetes deployments at [Visa](#visa-inc) (End User) and [VMware Tanzu](#vmware-tanzu) (Service Provider), playing a dual role of a security architect and engineer. He is also the co-creator of award winning container runtime security tool: [MASHUP](#awards)

In his free time, he loves taking photos, watching cricket and firmly believes that Chai fixes everything!

Pushkar is based in San Francisco Bay Area!

# [](#header-1)About me

Hi there, this is Pushkar D Joglekar.  I am currently working on the cross roads of information security, machine learning and distributed systems. Recently I have successfully led initiatives on Docker security, secrets management and data protection. 

In my spare time, I explore the beautiful Bay Area on his bike, capturing the scenes through his camera, sipping some hot chocolate while reading a book in a quaint coffee house.
